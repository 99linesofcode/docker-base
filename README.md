# git-skeleton

The starting point for my Git repositories. It provides the common configuration
files (`.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `.gitignore`, `.ignore`) that every
repository shares.

Some ecosystems and projects have their own dedicated skeleton repositories
that build upon this one and might serve as a better jumping off point. You can
find those at https://github.com/99linesofcode?tab=repositories&q=skeleton.

## How to use

1. `git init`
2. `git remote add origin <REPOSITORY>`
3. `git remote add git-skeleton git@github.com:99linesofcode/git-skeleton.git`
4. `git fetch git-skeleton`
5. `git rebase git-skeleton/main`

Updates flow the same way: `git fetch git-skeleton && git rebase git-skeleton/main`.
Conflicts on rebase are the divergence points — resolve them by keeping your
repo's override where it differs from the shared default.
